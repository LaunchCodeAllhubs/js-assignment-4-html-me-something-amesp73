         <p>Hello! This blog is for my dog Blair. 
            It contains some of her background story,

            <h2 class="secHeaders">Prior to Adoption</h2>
            <p>Prior to Blair, I had known for quite a while I wanted to adopt a dog. 
               I had grown up with dogs all my life and have always been a huge animal lover, 
               with an extra special soft spot for dogs. On my hunt for a pet,
               I knew I didn't want to adopt carelessly, I wanted to adopt for life.
               After hours upon hours of searching many websites and shelters,
               I saw the photos you see above. She wasn't the most presentable dog
               on the website, but something drew me to her. I contacted the shelter
               immediately and set up a meet and greet with her. I met her at her foster parent's
               house and was instantly taken with her. She was shy but was desperate to show 
               just how much love she was ready to give and receive. Her foster parent's shared
               that she was found roaming the streets scavenging for food, and had also appeared
               to have birthed a litter pretty recently. The litter was nowhere to be found and shelter
               staff assumed she was potentially used for breeding and dumped. She was also
               heartworm positive, which sadly meant people were not interested in the possible
               complications and expenses associated with that. This meant Blair had ZERO interest 
               in her, no one had inquired or applied to even meet her. We will never knew the 
               true story of what her life was, but on that day, I decided it doesn't matter, because
               every day after that will always be better. I stocked up on supplies and 
               took her home the very next day. Below you can read more about our journey!
