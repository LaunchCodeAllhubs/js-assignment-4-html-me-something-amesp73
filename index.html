            <p>
               Prior to Blair, I had known for quite a while I wanted to adopt a dog. 
               I had grown up with dogs all my life and have always been a huge animal lover, 
               with an extra special soft spot for dogs. On my hunt for a pet,
               I knew I didn't want to adopt carelessly, I wanted to adopt for life.
               After hours upon hours of searching many websites and shelters,
               I saw the photos you see above. She wasn't the most presentable dog
               on the website, but something drew me to her. I contacted the shelter
               immediately and set up a meet and greet with her. I met her at her foster parent's
               house and was instantly taken with her. She was shy but was desperate to show 
               just how much love she was ready to give and receive. Her foster parent's shared
               that she was found roaming the streets scavenging for food, and had also appeared
               to have birthed a litter pretty recently. The litter was nowhere to be found and shelter
               staff assumed she was potentially used for breeding and dumped. She was also
               heartworm positive, which sadly meant people were not interested in the possible
               complications and expenses associated with that. This meant Blair had ZERO interest 
               in her, no one had inquired or applied to even meet her. We will never knew the 
               true story of what her life was, but on that day, I decided it doesn't matter, because
               every day after that will always be better. I stocked up on supplies and 
               took her home the very next day. Below you can read more about our journey!

            <p>
               Walking out the door with Blair was quite possibly one of the most terrifying
               things. I almost turned right around and gave her back! The thought of owning
               a dog was great, but was I actually ready to change my life? Was I ready to adjust
               every aspect for a dog that I know hardly anything about? Well it was too late.
               To be honest, it was solely out of pure embarrassment that I didn't turn around.
               And I'm glad I didn't. Was it an adjustment? Major. I was used to doing things when
               I wanted to and going places when I wanted to.<br>
               <br>Within the first week I learned many things. She was an early riser, cue
               weekend 6am wake up calls. It was tiring and sometimes I could get her to sleep in, but
               we mostly just compromised with each other and adjusted.</br>
               <br>She was also reactive to every single animal out there. I found that out the hard 
               way on our walks when she almost took me down multiple times over a squirrel, a duck, 
               a deer, you name it. Neighbors would come to say hi and she'd snap at their dogs. We soon
               started to avoid times when everyone was out walking their dogs. It is not easy making
               friends with your neighbors when you have a reactive dog!</br>
               <br>She was also very dependent. She loved to be around me. If we are on the sofa,
               she's in my lap. After I shower, she is waiting outside the door. When I cook, she's
               right at my feet (I literally have to step over and around her the whole time).
               That part wasn't too hard to adjust to, dog cuddles are unparalled.</br>
               <br>There were many other things during the first week and over time I came to learn
               about Blair. Like I said, it was difficult, but I wouldn't change it for a thing.
