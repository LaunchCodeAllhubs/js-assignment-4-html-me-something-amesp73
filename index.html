         <p>Hello! This blog is for my dog Blair. 
            It contains some of her background story, 
            but also contains plenty of tales of her adventures since living with me. 
            These tales include the good times, the scary times, and the funny times.
            All in all, I wouldn't change it for a thing. Hope you enjoy reading it!

            <h2 class="headerTwo">Prior to Adoption</h2>
            <p>
               Prior to Blair, I had known for quite a while I wanted to adopt a dog. 
               I had grown up with dogs all my life and have always been a huge animal lover, 
               with an extra special soft spot for dogs. On my hunt for a pet,
               I knew I didn't want to adopt carelessly, I wanted to adopt for life.
               After hours upon hours of searching many websites and shelters,
               I saw the photos you see above. She wasn't the most presentable dog
               on the website, but something drew me to her. I contacted the shelter
               immediately and set up a meet and greet with her. I met her at her foster parent's
               house and was instantly taken with her. She was shy but was desperate to show 
               just how much love she was ready to give and receive. Her foster parent's shared
               that she was found roaming the streets scavenging for food, and had also appeared
               to have birthed a litter pretty recently. The litter was nowhere to be found and shelter
               staff assumed she was potentially used for breeding and dumped. She was also
               heartworm positive, which sadly meant people were not interested in the possible
               complications and expenses associated with that. This meant Blair had ZERO interest 
               in her, no one had inquired or applied to even meet her. We will never knew the 
               true story of what her life was, but on that day, I decided it doesn't matter, because
               every day after that will always be better. I stocked up on supplies and 
               took her home the very next day. Below you can read more about our journey!

            <h2 class="headerTwo">Adjusting to Our New Life</h2>
            <p>
               Walking out the door with Blair was quite possibly one of the most terrifying
               things. I almost turned right around and gave her back! The thought of owning
               a dog was great, but was I actually ready to change my life? Was I ready to adjust
               every aspect for a dog that I know hardly anything about? Well it was too late.
               To be honest, it was solely out of pure embarrassment that I didn't turn around.
               And I'm glad I didn't. Was it an adjustment? Major. I was used to doing things when
               I wanted to and going places when I wanted to.<br>
               <br>Within the first week I learned many things. She was an early riser, cue
               weekend 6am wake up calls. It was tiring and sometimes I could get her to sleep in, but
               we mostly just compromised with each other and adjusted.</br>
               <br>She was also reactive to every single animal out there. I found that out the hard 
               way on our walks when she almost took me down multiple times over a squirrel, a duck, 
               a deer, you name it. Neighbors would come to say hi and she'd snap at their dogs. We soon
               started to avoid times when everyone was out walking their dogs. It is not easy making
               friends with your neighbors when you have a reactive dog!</br>
               <br>She was also very dependent. She loved to be around me. If we are on the sofa,
               she's in my lap. After I shower, she is waiting outside the door. When I cook, she's
               right at my feet (I literally have to step over and around her the whole time).
               That part wasn't too hard to adjust to, dog cuddles are unparalled.</br>
               <br>There were many other things during the first week and over time I came to learn
               about Blair. Like I said, it was difficult, but I wouldn't change it for a thing.

            <p>
               I'll be fully transparent here, Blair is <b>the BEST</b> dog. She's loving, cuddly, and
               aims to please with everything. BUT, she's no hero or athlete dog by any means. She's never 
               saved a life or won a dog show competition. In fact, she'll probably find a way to do the opposite. 
               But all her qualities combined make her amazing. And with those qualities, every day with her
               is the best possible time. &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;

            <p>
               Now this section is where the meat of the content is. Blair has singlehandedly shaved a decade
               off my life. Whether it's things out of her control or things she willingly did, here are a
               couple of the <b>MANY</b> scary stories.

            <h3 class="headerThree">The Time She Ate A Boot</h3>
            <p>
               The week prior to Christmas 2022, I had been sick, and consequently, had been missing our
               daily walks, brain games, and mental training we did. I'm gone for work for 8 hours everyday,
               and on that Wednesday, I went to a Christmas dinner after work. Upon returning home, I walk 
               in the door and immediately step on a piece of leather. When I turn on the light, I see my
               duck boots completely torn apart and scattered all over the floor. Upon inspection, I noticed
               that the pieces that were left did not add up to the whoel pair of boots. I took her to the vet
               first thing the next morning, and they came to the conclusion that she needed surgery ASAP. She
               had metal ringlets all through her stomach and no amount of induced vomiting could get them out.
               Few days of loopiness later, she was back to her normal self (minus the incision)and I have 
               learned my leasson to never leave my shoes out when I leave!
